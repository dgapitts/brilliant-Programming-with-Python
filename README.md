# brilliant.org Programming-with-Python

I'm starting this beginner course as 
* I'm new to the brilliant.org platform and mobile app i.e. quite a lot of cognitive load learning a new platform (although it does seem prietty intuitive and attractive so far)
* It's always good to practise the basics from time to time
* There always going to be gaps e.g. I am very familiar with the modular (%) operator, but didn't know the double-slash (//) was a round down operator #TIL e.g. 130 secs is 2 mins and 10 secs
```
>>> print(130//60)
2
>>> print(130%60)
10
```
